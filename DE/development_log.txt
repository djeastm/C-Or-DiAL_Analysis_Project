9/19/17 11:00 am to 3:30 pm

- Added files from Dropbox to Github.
- Cleaned mismatched tags from CordialCorpus.xml 
- Created process_corpus.py to raw_output.txt from CordialCorpus_Cleaned.xml
- Downloaded FreeLing to local computer
- Input raw text into FreeLing to get freeling_output.txt
- Created process_freeling.py to count frequencies of parts of speech and output to separate text files
- Wrote comments and development log

9/26/17 4:30 pm to 6:30 pm

- Create process_freeling_breakdown.py to break down frequencies by subcategories based on FreeLing tags
- Renamed process_freeling.py to process_freeling_frequency.py

9/27/17 5:00 pm to 6:00 pm

- Training

9/28/17 2:00 pm to 4:30 pm

- Training

9/29/17 7:00 pm to 10:00 pm

- Created parse_breakdown.py to take output of process_freeling_breakdown.py and parse the tags associated with each part of speech
- This resulted in comma-separated files (*.csv files) that can be easily input into Excel or other database programs.
- Used RapidMiner (data mining software--free for educational use) to create bar chart of verb tense frequencies (verb_breakdown.png)

10/3/17 1:30 pm to 3:30 pm

- Created "Research Narrative.docx" to document the thought process behind my choices for future use
- Created Excel file Analysis.xlsx for breakdown of verbs by mood, tense, person, and number using RapidMiner.

10/4/17 10:30 am to 11:30 am

- Training

10/4/17 8:30 pm to 11:30 pm

- Created process_corpus_with_metadata.py to handle dividing the corpus into texts and keeping the header information

10/5/17 10:30 am to 11:30 am

- Added to Analysis.xlsx analyses of the verbs by category and by key words, as they appear in the headers.
- Archived files that didn't have metadata attached. They are superceded by the metadata-attached data files.

10/10/17 2:30 pm to 5:30 pm

- Attempted tagging all words in corpus *in situ* with process_corpus_with_metadata_pos_tagged.py
- The main issue appears to be that FreeLing output splits contractions and attached pronouns into separate words, making reforming the corpus tricky

10/13/17 9:00 am to 4:00 pm

- Further developed process_corpus_with_metadata_pos_tagged.py to deal with edge cases caused by idiosyncrasies in FreeLing output and corpus itself. 
- Documented code thus far.

10/15/17 3:00 pm to 7:00 pm

- Created a version of the previous script that abandoned the annotations that caused all the edge cases, in order to move forward with getting a reada1ble corpus with words tagged in place. Future work can be to find a way to include those annotations. The tagged corpus is in CorpusCordial_Tagged.xml. 
- Created process_tagged_corpus_with_metadata_xml_to_html.py in order to turn the xml into a readable
html document that can be used with javascript to highlight tagged words on command.
- Created process_tagged_corpus_with_metadata_html_format.py to make the html converted from xml into a nicer format, including adding titles for each text and printing the metadata in list format.
- These scripts result in a basic webpage with, thus far, some highlighting of verbs and nouns as desired. The webpage is stored as "CorpusCordial_Tagged_HTML_Formatted.html" in the folder corpus_html and can be viewed with any web browser.

10/18/17 6:00 pm to 9:30 pm

- Added functionality to CorpusCordial_Tagged_HTML_Formatted.html to enable selective highlighting based on all of the options returned by the FreeLing analyzer using Javascript. The script.js file is in the js folder in the corpus_html folder.

10/19/17 11:30 am to 12:00 pm

- Improved look/ease-of-use of web page using Bootstrap (a free CSS styling plugin from Twitter).

10/20/17 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm

- Attempted to improve functionality of filtering on web page using a tree data structure, but results were unsatisfactory (inefficient w.r.t time), so discarded changes.

10/24/17 5:30 pm to 7:30 pm

- Added frequency lists for filtering on webpage and documented code. Pushed new website version.

10/25/17 8:00 am to 9:00 am

- Added wildcard functionality to filtering

10/31/17 12:30 pm to 1:00 pm

- Added to Research Narrative

10/31/17 2:00 pm to 4:30 pm

- Created page to breakdown frequencies by situation (availably via link from normal page)

11/10/17 7:00 pm to 11:00 pm

- Found CORLEC spanish language oral corpus (788000+ words) from http://www.lllf.uam.es/ING/Corlec.html
- Created script to concatenate multiple files into one large raw file for processing.
- Created build_CORLEC_corpus.py to take corpus from raw state to html for the webpage

11/11/17 7:00 am to 9:30 am

- Developed build_CORLEC_corpus.py and reconfigured javascript and html page (including C-Or-DiAL page) to accommodate multiple corpuses along with sorting by situation (in CORLEC's case, the closest analog to situation was the category of the text, but this can be adjusted)
- Changed filenames to distiguish scripts and documents used for different corpuses
- Moved C-Or-DiAL-specific items into its own folder and created new folder for CORLEC items
- Changed name of "corpus_html" to "webpage"

11/11/17 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm

- Searched for Mexican/Latin American oral corpuses (none found)
- Added loading icon to webpage to alert user to delay on loading large CORLEC file

11/14/17 10:00 am to 11:00 am

- Added more sorting/grouping categories to both corpuses
